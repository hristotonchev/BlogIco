INSERT INTO `blog_posts` VALUES (1,'Superman','Superman is a superhero published by DC Comics since 1938. An alien named Kal-El from the destroyed planet Krypton. he was sent to Earth and raised as Clark Kent by human foster parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent. As an adult, Superman became the protector of Earth, working at the Daily Planet as Clark Kent along side his partner and wife Lois Lane.\r\n\r\nContents[show]\r\nBiography\r\nSent as a baby to Earth from the dying planet Krypton, Kal-El was adopted by Martha and Jonathan Kent of Smallville, Kansas. Growing up as Clark Kent, he devoted his life to helping others with the abilities he developed from Earth\'s sun. Moving to Metropolis, he became Superman, while still maintaining his secret identity as Clark Kent, who works at the Daily Planet newspaper.\r\n\r\nSuperman\'s birthday is February 29th.\r\n\r\nFor detailed biographies by continuity, see:\r\nSuperman\'s Biography (Modern Age) - Superman\'s history from Crisis on Infinite Earths to Flashpoint (with a brief hiatus between 2011 and 2015) and his return in Rebirth\r\nSuperman\'s Biography (Pre-Crisis) - Superman\'s history from 1938 to Crisis on Infinite Earths\r\nSuperman\'s Biography (Post-Flashpoint) - Superman\'s biography from the post-Flashpoint universe (marketed as the New 52)\r\nPersonality\r\nIn the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman\'s personality is rough and aggressive. He was seen stepping in to stop wife beaters, profiteers, a lynch mob and gangsters, with rather rough edges and a looser moral code than we may be used to today. In later adventures he became, softer, and had more of a sense of idealism and moral code of conduct. Although not as cold-blooded as the early Batman, the Superman featured in the comics of the 1930s is unconcerned about the harm his strength may cause, tossing villainous characters in such a manner that fatalities would presumably occur, although these were seldom shown explicitly on the page. This came to an end when Superman vowed never to take a life.\r\n\r\nSuperman is an extremely moral person, believing it immoral to kill anyone under any circumstances, and will do whatever he can to avoid it. Clark\'s upbringing in the Midwest largely contributes to this, as his adoptive parents raised him to do the right thing.\r\n\r\nIn Superman/Batman #3, Batman says, &quot;It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then...he shoots fire from the skies, and it is difficult not to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to him.&quot;\r\n\r\nSuperman is also a bit of a loner, in that, for much of his life, he doesn\'t reveal his true identity and powers to anyone, not even his closest friends. Many times they come close to figuring it out on their own, but often he will arrange an elaborate deception to trick them into believing Clark Kent and Superman are entirely separate. He\'s known to collect mementos of his adventures and his life in the Fortress of Solitude, and has even been known to have wax statues of all his friends there.\r\n\r\nPowers and Abilities\r\nSuperman possesses the ability to fly under his own power, incredible strength and near invulnerability, as he can only be harmed by the element Kryptonite. His eyes can emit bursts of heat, while vision ranges from the microscopic to the telescopic. His vision is also capable of a broader spectrum than human eyes, able to see x-rays and radio waves. He can hear faint sounds amongst a bustle of noises by concentrating. His lungs are capable of holding air for long periods of time in environments without oxygen, and the ability to compress this air and exhale it in a freezing capacity.','2018-01-11 18:27:05',1),(2,'Wonder Woman','Diana of Themyscira is an Amazonian warrior princess and superhero known as Wonder Woman. In modern times, she works as an antiquities dealer at the Louvre Museum as Diana Prince. She is the daughter of the Amazons\' Queen Hippolyta and the king of the Olympian Gods, Zeus. She is also known as the &quot;Godkiller&quot;, having been originally conceived to be the ultimate weapon against her mighty half-brother Ares\' unquenchable bloodlust and warfare powers.\r\n\r\nDiana serves as an emissary and ambassador from Themyscira, charged with the mission of bringing peace, compassion, love, and understanding to the outside world (as that was the original purpose which Zeus created the Amazons for). After meeting Steve Trevor, she would aid the Allied Powers during World War I, join the Wonder Men, and ultimately defeat General Ludendorff, Dr. Poison, and even Ares himself.\r\n\r\nThe loss of her allies in World War I (notably the Belgian villagers whom she was unable to save from Dr. Poison, as well as her beloved Steve Trevor) had left Diana psychologically scarred and she ultimately chose to abandon superheroics and humanity for the next 100 years. Despite this, she could not bear standing idly by as the bloodthirsty juggernaut Doomsday wreaked havoc, thus, she allied herself with Superman and Batman to take him down. With Superman killed by the monster, Wonder Woman and Batman would be inspired by his noble sacrifice (with her being reminded of Steve Trevor\'s) to begin establishing the Justice League, in order to battle any future threats to the world.\r\n\r\nShortly after the team assembled, Wonder Woman assisted in restraining a newly resurrected Superman. With the team now fully assembled, Wonder Woman contributes to the successful offensive against Steppenwolf, forcing the alien invasion into retreat. Following this, Wonder Woman finally reveals herself to the world, becoming an official superheroine, as further plans for the Justice League are made by Batman.','2017-12-01 19:37:17',1),(3,'Flash','Barry Allen is The Flash, the fastest man alive. Using his super-speed powers, he taps into the Speed Force and becomes a costumed crime-fighter. His position is a legacy in the Flash Family, successor to the original Jay Garrick and predecessor to Wally West. He is a founding member of the Justice League of America.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nMain article: Flash Origins\r\nBarry Allen and a twin brother were born two weeks late, to Henry and Nora Allen in the small midwestern town of Fallville, Iowa. The brother was pronounced stillborn by Dr. Gilmore. However, in actuality, he had been born healthy, but given to another family, the Thawnes, whose child had died during birth. The lateness of Barry\'s birth only foreshadowed his bad habit of always being late. Barry grew up reading the adventures of his favorite superhero, Jay Garrick, the original Flash and acted many of his hero\'s adventures out with his friend and future actress, Daphne Dean.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a child, his mother was killed and his father was convicted of the crime. The drive to prove his father was innocent gave Barry a strong belief in justice.\r\n\r\nIn high school, Barry had a reputation for being slow and easy-going. On his first date, he went to a carnival. His date had wanted to put a little motion in his life, and they went on the roller-coaster first thing. Because of this, he developed a fear of roller-coasters, a fear that he didn\'t get rid of until much later in his life.\r\n\r\nBarry loved chemistry from an early age, and that helped his skills as a farmer. He won first place in the Fallville County Fair Agricultural Competition, a prize which included a scholarship to Sun City University. He graduated in three years with a major in organic chemistry and a minor in criminology.\r\n\r\nWhile a senior, Barry helped the authorities apprehend a bank robber, and he was offered a job as a police scientist for the Central City Police Department Scientific Detection Bureau. Eager to be in the sister city of his childhood hero\'s home, Keystone City, he accepted the offer.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to Central City and getting an apartment with a laboratory in the back, Barry began dating Picture News reporter Iris West, whom he met while examining an apparent murder that she was reporting. She was charmed by his honesty and stability.\r\n\r\nThat night during an electrical storm, Barry returned to an experiment after a short break. All of a sudden, a bolt of lightning streaked through a window, shattered a chemical cabinet and covered Barry in the electrified chemicals. Dazed, he decided to return home in a taxi. However, the taxi started to pull away without noticing him. Barry sprinted after it, only to run straight past it as if it had been standing still. He decided to sit down and recollect his thoughts at a diner. A passing waitress accidentally spilled the items of her tray onto Barry, who amazingly caught them all in mid-air and returns them to the tray. The next day, Barry saved Iris from a stray bullet. There was no question about it: the freak accident had somehow given Barry superhuman speed!\r\n\r\nThe Flash\r\nDeciding to use his powers to help humanity, Barry designed a special costume. He used a special cold cast polyester he developed in college, which could be molded into miniature outfits from liquid material, that, when submerged in a special liquid, became sensitive to hydrogen, expanding on contact with the hydrogen in the air. A charge from a battery-powered ring he wore on his finger caused the fabric to release the extra hydrogen and shrink into the ring. He later revised the process, making the fabric sensitive to nitrogen instead. He called himself the Flash, a tribute to his childhood idol He briefly considered wearing a costume that would show his face, like Jay had, but decided that it would be best to wear a mask to conceal his true identity.[1] The first villain he faced was the Turtle Man.\r\n\r\nJustice League\r\nMain article: Justice League Origins\r\nAs the Flash, Barry later became a founding member of the Justice League of America, where he befriended Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern, with whom he had many adventures both with and without the Justice League. Later still, he discovered that Jay Garrick was real, and became friends with him as well.\r\n\r\nKid','2017-12-01 19:38:26',1),(4,'Batman','Batman is the superhero protector of Gotham City, a man dressed like a bat who fights against evil and strikes terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his secret identity he is Bruce Wayne, billionaire industrialist and notorious playboy. Although he has no superhuman powers, he is one of the world\'s smartest men and greatest fighters. His physical prowess and technical ingenuity make him an incredibly dangerous opponent. He is also a founding member of the Justice League and the Outsiders.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nMain article: Batman Origins\r\nEarly Life\r\nJoe Chill murders Thomas and Martha Wayne\r\n\r\nJoe Chill murders Thomas and Martha Wayne\r\nAs a young child, Bruce Wayne watched his parents murdered before his eyes. Thomas and Martha Wayne were walking home from the Monarch Theater one night with their son, when they were held up at gunpoint by a mugger who demanded the pearl necklace that Martha was wearing. When Dr. Wayne refused to surrender it, both he and Martha were shot dead in the streets.[2] The killer was a criminal known as Joe Chill.[3] Fortunately, physician and social worker Leslie Thompkins was making a house call that night, and arrived to give loving comfort to the traumatized Bruce. He was then raised on the Wayne Manor estate, with help from the wise and loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Bruce had very few friends during his childhood.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nBruce Wayne swore an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents\' lives. He spent his youth traveling the world, training himself to intellectual and physical perfection and learning a variety of crime-fighting skills, including chemistry, criminology, forensics, martial arts, gymnastics, disguise, and escape artistry.\r\n\r\nAt age 14, Bruce Wayne began his global sojourn, attending courses at Cambridge, the Sorbonne, and other European universities. However, he never stayed long and would often drop out after one semester. Beyond academia, Wayne successfully acquired various &quot;practical&quot; skills. While abroad, he studied and received training in multiple martial arts under various instructors and in different countries, man-hunting under Frenchman Henri Ducard,[4] stealth and reconnaissance under the Japanese ninja Kirigi[5] and other certified shinobi, hunting under the African Bushman (the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-Eyed Brotherhood, among others), hand-to hand combat under the tutelage of Ted Grant, a World Champion Boxer and David Cain, one of the world\'s premier assassins;[6][7] traditional healing disciplines under Nepalese monks and even ventriloquism under skilled practitioners [8]. Bruce was also trained in archery by Oliver Queen.[9] At the age of 17, Bruce was trained by detective Harvey Harris to improve his detective skills.[10] At age 20, he attempted to join the FBI, but after learning about its regulations and conduct, Wayne deducted that he would never be able to completely oppose crime while working within the legal system.\r\n\r\nBatman Begins\r\nMain article: Batman: Year One\r\nBruce Wayne returned to Gotham City after many years of study and training with his body and mind developed to perfection. Despite having all of the skills and methods to fight crime, he still felt that there was something missing in the completion of his physical and mental arsenal. Wayne discovered the answer late one night while sitting in his manor. He recalled his fear of bats as a child after a large one crashed through one of the windows; he ultimately decided to make his appearance resemble a bat\'s. Wayne designed himself a costume equipped with experimental technology and set out against the crime and corruption that thrived in Gotham City.\r\n\r\nWayne\'s tactics to oppose crime as a vigilante at night proved successful leading him to become an urban legend in Gotham City. He revealed himself at a dinner of the most influential and corrupt figures in Gotham City and promised them all that their reigns on the city would eventually end. Wayne\'s first ally was assistant district attorney Harvey Dent.[11] Most of the Gotham City Police Department was sent in force to capture him.[12] He gained his most powerful ally when he met police lieutenant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops on the force. The two developed a working relationship operating outside of the law when they needed to.','2017-12-01 19:40:25',1),(5,'Aqua man','Aquaman is the telepathic ruler of Atlantis and the Earth\'s oceans, an Atlantean with incredible strength and speed as well as the ability to command all sea-life. His unique physiology allows him to survive on land and at the ocean\'s greatest depths of pressure and temperature. Given the names Orin through his royal heritage and Arthur Curry by his human upbringing, he fights to protect both worlds using his mighty abilities and political influence. He is a founding member of the Justice League of America.\r\n\r\nOrigins\r\nMain article: Aquaman Origins\r\nOriginally in Silver Age continuity Arthur Curry was the son of a lighthouse keeper named Tom Curry and a woman named Atlanna. Tom Curry lived in Amnesty Bay, Maine and raised his son with wife in the local Lighthouse. Arthur started to manifest incredible strength and speed at a young age, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and talk to fish. On her deathbed, his mother revealed that she was an exiled Queen of Atlantis and he would someday inherit rule of the seven seas. His father gave him an education and taught him to control his powers, eventually allowing him to grow up and become the super-hero Aquaman.[1]\r\n\r\nAquaman 0143\r\nCurse of Kordax\r\nHis origins were changed when the universe was rebooted during the Crisis on Infinite Earths.[2] Orin was born an heir to the Atlantean Royal Family. His mother Atlanna had been unable to conceive a child with her husband King Trevis, but she was impregnated during a dream by the immortal wizard Atlan. Atlan prophesized the child\'s future and named him after his ancestor Orin, promising that he would sire another son because two brothers must always struggle for the fate of Atlantis. Trevis immediately knew the child wasn\'t his because of the blond hair, a long-held superstition that a child might carry the curse of Kordax. The baby was announced as a miscarriage and left to die on Mercy Reef, where his ability to communicate with sealife allowed him to be raised by Dolphins.[3] His adopted mother was named Porm and she gave him the name Swimmer, although he left this new family after fisherman killed his adopted brother Drin.[4] \r\nAquaman 0010\r\nAquaman visits the surface\r\nHis next encounter with humanity was a lighthouse operator named Tom Curry who took him in as a son, giving him the human name Arthur Curry before his death.[5] Spending time in Alaska, he met and fell in love with the beautiful eskimo girl Kako. They conceived a child together, but the demonic god Nuliajuk forced Arthur to leave before he could learn of the pregnancy.[6] His next fight against a God would be Poseidon\'s son Triton when he rescued Princess Diana from his sexual advances.[7] Returning to Atlantis, he was arrested and sentenced to hard labor in the Aquarium prison. He found mentorship in the former professor Vulko who taught him Atlantean, although he decided to escape when he learned that his birth mother had died.[5] Curry\'s first encounter with another super-hero was The Flash, who named him &quot;Aquaman&quot; during a press conference in Crescent Shore after they fought the Trickster.[8] Upon his next return, Orin learns that Vulko has led a revolution and claims his birthright as the King of Atlantis.[5][9]\r\nThis has supposedly changed during Infinite Crisis, as a conversation with Jackson Hyde during Brightest Day reveals him to be once again the son of Atlanna and lighthouse keeper Tom Curry.[10]\r\n\r\nJustice League\r\nMain article: Justice League Origins\r\nAquaman would go on to become a founding member of the Justice League of America, although their origins have been altered several times in continuity. The original founding members included Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Superman and Wonder Woman. They met for the first time during an alien invasion by the Appellaxians.[11] This was later amended Post-Crisis to write Batman and Superman out of the story, with Wonder Woman replaced by Black Canary.[12][13]','2017-12-01 19:41:10',1),(6,'Green Lantern','Green Lantern is a name that has been used by many characters in the DC Universe, and two distinct franchises. The original during the Golden Age was businessman Alan Scott, who wore a magic power ring that created energy constructs and had to be charged using his mystic lantern. &quot;Green Lantern&quot; was reimagined in the Silver Age as test pilot Hal Jordan, a member of an intergalactic peacekeeping force called the Green Lantern Corps. The Guardians of the Universe on Oa give these Lanterns rings controlled by willpower, and send them to patrol all 3600 sectors of the known universe. Jordan was said to be a member of the Justice League on Earth-One, and Scott was said to be a member of the Justice Society on Earth-Two. Their timelines were merged during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and it was explained that Scott\'s magic ring taps into the Starheart. There have been several other human Green Lanterns of Sector 2814. The brash Guy Gardner and later the architect John Stewart were both originally introduced as replacements for Jordan. Kyle Rayner became the fifth and only Green Lantern when Jordan turned into the evil Parallax and destroyed the Corps during Emerald Twilight. The Corps has since been rebuilt with all Lanterns serving simultaneously. Muslim engineer Simon Baz would become the sixth. PTSD victim Jessica Cruz became the seventh after inheriting the Ring of Volthoom from Power Ring of the Crime Syndicate. The Alan Scott version of Green Lantern was created by Bill Finger and Martin Nodell, first appearing in All-American Comics #16. (1940) The Hal Jordan version was created by John Broome and Gil Kane after an initial concept by Julius Schwartz, first appearing in Showcase #22. (1959)','2017-12-01 19:42:35',1),(7,'Martian Manhunter','Origin\r\nCenturies ago on the planet Ma\'aleca\'andra, the Green Martians known as M\'yrnn and Sha\'sheen gave birth to twin sons. The bearing of twins was uncommon among the Martian culture, and as such, the first of the twins was named J\'onn J\'onzz, whose name means &quot;Light to the Light.&quot; J\'onn\'s brother, however, was born a mutant, bereft of a Martian\'s innate ability to communicate telepathically. He was named Ma\'alefa\'ak, whose name means &quot;Darkness in the Heart.&quot;\r\n\r\nAs an adult, J\'onn became a Manhunter (police officer) and married a Martian woman named M\'yri\'ah. The two established a modest home for themselves beneath the windswept Martian plains and gave birth to a daughter named K\'hym.\r\n\r\nYears passed, and J\'onn\'s brother Ma\'alefa\'ak grew to despise everything about Martian culture. In an ambitious endeavor to commit full-scale genocide against his own people, he engineered a contagious virus known as H\'ronmeer\'s Curse. The virus reacted to telepathic energy and carried from one Martian to the next whenever they elected to use their psionic powers. The plague responded to a Martian\'s innate fear of fire, causing them psychosomatic stress so intense, that their bodies and minds would literally burst into flame. J\'onn desperately tried to keep his wife and daughter from using their mental gifts, but they were unable to do so, and thus ultimately contracted the virus. K\'hym was the first to experience the symptoms, and M\'yri\'ah followed soon after. J\'onn was anguished as he watched his family burning to death before his very eyes. The trauma of the event shattered his psyche, and nearly drove him mad.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Earth\r\nMeanwhile, on the planet Earth, a would-be scientist named Dr. Saul Erdel developed a transmitter machine based upon ancient Martian technology. Seeking to make contact with extraterrestrial life, he aimed his device towards the vicinity of Mars and activated it. The transmitter beam streaked across both space and time, striking the Martian Manhunter at a point in time several centuries before Erdel would even be born. The beam brought J\'onn back to Erdel\'s natural time era, where he collapsed on the ground outside of the doctor\'s Colorado laboratory.\r\n\r\nJonn Jonnz First App\r\nAs he first appears to Erdel\r\nErdel brought the distraught Martian inside and attempted to nurse him back to health. The anguish of J\'onn\'s mental state created a psychic bond between the two, and Erdel became aware of the events that took place on Mars. In an effort to heal J\'onn\'s mind, Erdel used the mental link to fabricate a new history for the Martian. He created a back-story inspired by the writings of famous science fiction novelists such as Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Eventually, J\'onn\'s sanity was restored, and he was prepared to function in this strange, new world. Erdel put the idea into his head that he should become a great champion, and thus J\'onn adopted the heroic guise of the Martian Manhunter.\r\n\r\nWhen J\'onn shapeshifts into a human-like form, Erdel is shocked and suffers from a heart attack that kills him. Erdel asks J\'onn for forgiveness for making him a prisoner of Earth.[1] He is able to use his powers to fit in, adopting a human-like appearance and calling himself Detective &quot;John Jones.&quot; He joins the police force, secretly using his alien powers to help the inhabitants of his new planet. It was during this time that he spent the next few years battling the menace known as the Idol Head of Diabolu. Deciding that he needed to free himself from his human persona in order to more effectively combat evil, he is ostensibly &quot;killed in action&quot; by the Idol Head, or so he wished it to appear. Shortly after giving up his John Jones persona, J\'onn took the alias of Marco Xavier in order to infiltrate the international crime cartel known as VULTURE. Early on, the Manhunter from Mars adopted a more characteristically super-heroic modus operandi, openly fighting crime in a green-skinned form.','2017-12-01 19:43:50',1),(8,'Hawkgirl','Hawkgirl is a legacy name used by female counterparts to the super-hero Hawkman. She wields a mace and uses Nth Metal technology to fly. Carter Hall\'s wife Shiera Sanders was the first to use the name during the Golden Age, although Katar Hol\'s wife Shayera Hol from the planet Thanagar used it during the Silver Age before choosing the name of Hawkwoman. Kendra Saunders, a reincarnation of Shiera, would also take the name until she was murdered during Blackest Night. The character has been involved with the All-Star Squadron, Birds of Prey, Justice League and Justice Society. Hawkgirl was created by Gardner Fox, Dennis Neville and Sheldon Moldoff, first appearing in Flash Comics #1. (1940)','2018-02-19 19:23:51',1);
